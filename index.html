    <h1>My Perfect Trip</h1>
    
    <p>
        If I could take the perfect trip, I would visit the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand. The lush, green hills and stunning coastlines would be breathtaking. I would spend my days hiking and exploring the national parks, surrounded by majestic mountains and pristine lakes.

    <p>
        During my trip, I would love to see a variety of exotic animals, including kiwis, penguins, and dolphins. Exploring the diverse ecosystems of New Zealand would allow me to witness these incredible creatures in their natural habitats.

        No trip would be complete without indulging in delicious food. I would enjoy a perfectly cooked burger and fries, accompanied by local wines and fresh vegetables. It would be the ultimate culinary experience.

    <h1>All about rabbits!</h1>
    
    <h2 id="rabbits-info-heading">Basic info</h2>
    
    <p>Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. They eat the most orange vegetables in <em>our</em> world, and <strong>they reproduce more than any human <em>ever</em> has</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Songs</h2>
    
    <p id="rabbits-song">Little Bunny Foo Foo, <br>
I don't want to see you <br>
scooping up the field mice <br>
and bopping them on the head!</p>
    
    <p>And down came the Good Fairy <br>
And she said <br>
"Little bunny Foo Foo <br>
I don't like you're attitude <br>
Scooping up the field mice <br>
And bopping 'em on the head" <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>I'll give you 3 chances. <br>
Then I'll turn you into a goon! <br>
The next dayâ€¦</p>
